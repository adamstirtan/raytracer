When I was in University one of my projects was to write a ray tracer. The course was https://www.cosc.brocku.ca/Offerings/4P98/.

This code is me working on modernizing that project as a Blazor WebAssembly app.
When I originally wrote it I rendered my singles images on my AMD Athlon XP single core CPU. A 1024x768 render took 15+ minutes.
These days we have home video game consoles with real-time ray tracing. So let's see what that original code can do with a modern CPU!
